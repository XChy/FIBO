[Opt name] Missed optimization : ...

Alive2 proof: alive2 link
Missed example: godbolt link

### Motivating example 

```llvm
```

(xxx / can be folded to)

```llvm
```

### Real-world motivation

This snippet of IR is derived from xxx (after O3 pipeline).
The example above is a reduced version. If you're interested in the original suboptimal IR and optimal IR, see also:

**Let me know if you can confirm that it's an optimization opportunity, thanks.**
